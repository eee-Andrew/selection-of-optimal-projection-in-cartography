# selection-of-optimal-projection-in-cartography
In cartography, the selection of a suitable map projection is crucial for accurately representing the Earth's curved surface on a flat map. The project "Selection of Optimal Projection in Cartography" aims to explore various map projections and develop a methodology for selecting the most appropriate projection for different mapping scenarios.
The above project was inspired by a common exercise that the student surveyors do at the national technical university of Athens. They are asked to solve complex triangular equations to find the optimal projection.
